# Coffee_Machine_Simulation
This project is a Python-based simulation of a coffee vending machine, designed to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The simulation allows users to interact with the machine, choose their preferred drink, manage payments, and handle maintenance tasks such as restocking supplies.
