# Coffee_Machine_Simulation
This project is a Python-based simulation of a coffee vending machine, designed to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The simulation allows users to interact with the machine, choose their preferred drink, manage payments, and handle maintenance tasks such as restocking supplies.

**OOP Concepts Demonstrated: -**

-> Inheritance: The CoffeeMachine class inherits from the User class, showcasing how to extend base functionality and add specialized features.

-> Encapsulation: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes, promoting modularity and reusability.

-> Method Overriding: Custom behavior is implemented in the CoffeeMachine class to handle specific drink vending logic.

-> Class Interaction: The interaction between the User class and the CoffeeMachine class illustrates how objects can work together to form a cohesive program.

**Features**

-> User Interaction: The program takes input from users to select drinks, manage payments, and decide on sugar levels.

-> Drink Vending Logic: Handles the dispensing of different types of coffee (Latte, Espresso, Cappuccino) based on available resources.

-> Maintenance Mode: A special mode to restock coffee, milk, and sugar, ensuring the machine is always ready to serve.
